My introduction to the world of Nature was a painful one. Aged five,
I was coming down the spiral staircase from the roof of our
bungalow, when inadvertently I dislodged a beehive under one of
the steps. I was immediately attacked by a swarm of angry bees,
who proceeded to sting me on my face, arms and legs. I got down
the stairs and ran indoors screaming for help.
